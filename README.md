- My name is Henri, a 14 year old student who is learning how to develop. I'm currently learning HTML, but I'll soon be learning JavaScript and CSS with CodeNation.

ðŸ¤” What I want to accomplish
-----------------------------
- I want to develop my first few wesbites, and try to work on making tools using JavaScript.
- I would like to make it a goal to make my first program, no matter how simple it might be, and no matter how much I'll have to learn.
- I'd like to take this new experience to apply this to other things throughout my life.
